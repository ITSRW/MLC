Chaos optimization algorithm is a kind of intelligent optimization algorithm which can be used to solve the extreme value of complex continuous function. Compared with the classical optimization algorithms such as genetic algorithm, simulated annealing algorithm and ant colony algorithm, it has stronger global search ability.
The piecewise Lorenz chaotic model is improved and designed, and the simulation results show that the model has better search uniformity and robustness than the logistic chaotic series model; secondly, base on the model, the modified solution is generated by the optimal order stack to avoid the local optimum of folds, and the variable density oscillation search rule is constructed to design a new chaotic optimization algorithm.
The algorithm can effectively solve the problems of less than 20 dimensions, but it is difficult to solve the problems of higher dimensions. The research shows that the algorithm has better global search performance, but it lacks neighborhood convergence mechanism seriously, and needs to be improved in the future research.
